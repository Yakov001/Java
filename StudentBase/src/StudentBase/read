  This program is used for storing and changing a database of students in college. The program reads a file of
existing students (the text should be written in a predetermined order for the program to read it). It then creates
the array of student objects and allows the user to Add new students, Change the parameters of existing students, View
the list of students and exit the program.

  When exiting, the program will write the new list of students to a file in a specific format for further use.
